<p class="lead mt-5">
  The original version of LIFTI was written in 2010 and hosted on <a
    href="https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=lifti">CodePlex</a>
  and evolved to become quite complicated, including automatic persistance to a backing file and support for
  distributed transactions.
</p>
<p>
  Support for netstandard1.3 was added by directly porting it and stripping out incompatible parts, primarily to
  enable use in a personal UWP project <a href="https://chordle.com">Chordle</a>. This became the beta version of the
  LIFTI
  package, and version 1.0.0 of the Lifti.Core package that was largely untouched for years.
</p>
<p>
  This new version is a re-write in netstandard2 trying to re-focus on keeping it simple.
